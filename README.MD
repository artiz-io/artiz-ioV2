# Before installing
Make sure you have Node, Gulp and Bower installed globally.

# Install
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. `npm install` generates a `node_modules` folder and the `dist` folder. The `dist` folder can be used to serve the website.

# Development
Run `gulp` to run the watch server. Only edit files in the `/src` folder. Open `/dist/index.hmtl` to view the result.
