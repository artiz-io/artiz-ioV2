# Before installing
Make sure you have Node, Gulp and Bower installed globally.

# Install
Run `yarn` to install all dependencies. `yarn` generates a `node_modules` folder and the `client/dist` folder. The `client/dist` folder will be used to serve the website. The `api` folder serves up the API.

# Development
Run `yarn dev` to run the watch server. Only edit files in the `client/src` folder. You can open http://localhost:3000 to view the current local changes.
